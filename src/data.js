        Even tho I'am spending most of my time in React now, I try not to forget the father of it all which HTML undoubtly is!

        React is where I feel like at home these days :). It allows me execute my ideas with confidence in sustainabity in very short amount of time. 
        In conjunction with Redux, Axios, Thunk and many other libraries like GSAP, MagicScroll, or custom hooks, its an unstoppable toolset at my
